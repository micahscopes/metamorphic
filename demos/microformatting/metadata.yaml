      I considered writing a nice poem for this demo post. But I'm not in the
      mood to just willy-nilly whip out some silly poem at the moment.
      Maybe another time.

    title: A fall snack

      It's time for a snack.  You may expect this post to contain a wealth of information
      on healthy snack options.  Well, look no further than <em>apples and cheese.</em>

      In case you didn't already know, apples and cheese go together very well.
      It's something even many children are well aware of.

      Never tried it?  Maybe you didn't know?  Don't worry, because it's never too late
      to try something new.

      It's been said that <em>you can't teach "an old dog new tricks"...</em>

      But if you are trying to teach some old dog a new trick of eating a
      quality treat, such as a slice of cheese, combined with a slice of autumn apple,
      well then the old dog is going to catch on very quickly.

      So really, that saying depends on what exactly the trick is that you're
      trying to convey to the dog.
