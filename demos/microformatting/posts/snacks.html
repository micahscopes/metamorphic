<h1>A fall snack</h1>
<h2>Who doesn't like snacks?</h2>
Posted by <span id="author">Micah</span> on <time>October 4, 2016</time>

<main>It's time for a snack.  You may expect this post to contain a wealth of information
on healthy snack options.  Well, look no further than <em>apples and cheese.</em>

In case you didn't already know, apples and cheese go together very well.
It's something even many children are well aware of.

Never tried it?  Maybe you didn't know?  Don't worry, because it's never too late
to try something new.

It's been said that <em>you can't teach "an old dog new tricks"...</em>

But if you are trying to teach some old dog a new trick of eating a
quality treat, such as a slice of cheese, combined with a slice of autumn apple,
well then the old dog is going to catch on very quickly.

So really, that saying depends on what exactly the trick is that you're
trying to convey to the dog.
